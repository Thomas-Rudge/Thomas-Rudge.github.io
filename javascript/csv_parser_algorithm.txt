Assumptions;
> A csv cell that contains a delimeter character will preceed and end with double quotes.
> A csv cell that contains a double quote character will have that character escaped by another double quote.
> Therefore the number of double quotes between two cell delimeters will either be zero or even, and in all other cases be odd.

Variables to track;
c 	  = the current characters
cellValue = the current cell value as a string
dq 	  = The number of double quotes currently counted in the current section (integer)
cells 	  = The computed cell values (array)
lines     = The list of line cells


For line in lines:
   For var c in line:
      if the character is a double quote
         dq += 1
         continue
      if the character is a comma
         if dq is even or 0:
            cells.push(cellValue.replace('""', '"'))
            cellValue = ''
            dq = 0
            continue
      cellValue += c
   lines.push(cells)
   cells = []
